            <img src="./screenshot.png" width="75%">
            <p>I have been using Linux for the past 3 years or so now. I have hopped from distro to distro, sometimes on a monthly or weekly basis, and I believe that now, at long last, I have finally found the distro to call my home.</p>
            <p>Allow me to start with a bit of back story first.</p>
            <hr />
            <h2 id="prelude-to-linux">Prelude to Linux</h2>
            <p>When I first started looking into Linux, believe it or not, it was because I had become interested in macOS. I had been a long time Windows user (like, 13+ years at this point), and Apple, having just been releasing OS X Maverics, had finally peaked my interest.</p>
            <p>I started doing what I always do when something new and exiting catches my eye, I started looking into it. Scouring the search engines of the internet for any information that I could find on it.</p>
            <p>I came to find out, via Wikipedia, that OS X was a Unix like operating system. I thought to myself “Unix? I wonder what that is.” and preceded to start looking a bit into that as well.</p>
            <p>Many a Windows customization later, and another year or so (2014 at this point, give or take), and I start finding out about Linux.</p>
            <hr />
            <h2 id="discovering-linux">Discovering Linux</h2>
            <p>I clearly remember this one website from when I first really started to look into Linux. Well, more so a specific page from a website. It was a sorta top ten Linux distros for something or other. The only distro I clearly remember from it was <a class="inline-link" href="https://redhat.com/">Redhat</a> (and I think <a class="inline-link" href="https://getfedora.org/">Fedora</a> as well.)</p>
            <p>I started doing a bit of research into Redhat and such, and started to learn more and more about this cool new ‘Linux’ thing. Eventually, and I truly cannot remember how, I stumbled upon <a class="inline-link" href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>. I’m not quite sure how long it was between me doing a bit of research on Ubuntu and burning it onto a DVD, but by Winter 2014, I was ready to install Ubuntu onto a machine.</p>
            <hr />
            <h2 id="early-days-of-linux">Early Days of Linux</h2>
            <p>Before I went and installed Linux onto anything (I don’t think I was even using virtual machines at the time,) I was still primarily a Windows user, and didn’t want to do anything that would end up with me being SoL. Thankfully, I was by no means a computer illiterate (especially for my age at the time,) and had a spare hard drive lying around.</p>
            <p>I ended up swapping out the hard drive in my desktop, as to be sure that I did not do anything to mess up my Windows install, and I preceded to insert the disc into the drive, and went on with installing Ubuntu.</p>
            <p>With it being the time it was, I installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Trusty Tahr onto my machine, and boy was that a new experience. Trusty used Unity 7 as it’s desktop environment, and for anybody moving from Windows, without having used another OS before (not counting mobile), it was quite the change in user experience.</p>
            <p>I found it weird and cool at the same time. It definitely took some getting used to, with the launcher and what not. I got comfortable with it eventually, and even started to use the terminal! At this point it was still something that I was playing around with, and I used it off and on with that machine for a while.</p>
            <p>I was still using Windows 7 as my primary OS, so I was not using Ubuntu as much as I was using Windows, but I was using it enough to have it keeping my interest and wanting to go back to using it from time to time, just for a bit of change of pace.</p>
            <hr />
            <h2 id="getting-hooked-on-linux">Getting Hooked on Linux</h2>
            <p>In early 2016, I found this article through Flipboard about this Linux distro called <a class="inline-link" href="https://ubuntu-mate.org/">Ubuntu MATE</a> and it’s Software Boutique in it’s upcoming 16.04 release. By that point, I was familiar enough with what Ubuntu was and what this upcoming version was, but I had never heard of Ubuntu MATE.</p>
            <p>I remember reading the article and thinking “Wow! This is actually a something pretty cool! I quite like the approach of this Software Boutique,” and after a couple of months had past, 16.04 had arrived. I think it was the beginning of May that I grabbed the ISO, slapped it onto an install media (I think I might have used a flash drive,) and installed it onto that same desktop from before.</p>
            <p>I was quite honestly blown away with Ubuntu MATE. I rather enjoyed the interface, that I could easily change the panel layout between presets and customize it to my liking, and just how it felt to use it.</p>
            <p>I used the Software Boutique to install different software as I browsed through it, and became more acquainted with the OS as I continued to use it. It definitely had it’s fair share of paper cut issues at the time, mainly with the panel when changing predefined layouts, but I enjoyed using it all the same.</p>
            <p>I ended up installing it on a couple other of my machines, including my Dell Latitude D830, and dual booting it with Windows 7 on my HP EliteBook 8540w. Eventually, during that summer, I finally pulled the trigger and wiped my Windows partition off the EliteBook, and officially started using Linux as my full-time, primary OS. I was hooked on Linux at this point, and was ready to finally leave Windows behind.</p>

            <h2 id="starting-to-distro-hop">Starting to Distro Hop</h2>
            <p>Now that I was using Linux as my main OS, I started to get interested in other distros. Having used Ubuntu proper before, and from what research I had done in the past, I knew there was more out there. And I was ready to start trying it all out.</p>
            <p>My first real pull towards distro hopping came in the form of <a class="inline-link" href="https://ubuntugnome.org/">Ubuntu GNOME</a>. The GNOME 3 desktop was something quite new to me, and I was dying to try it out! I grabbed the ISO for Ubuntu GNOME, slapped it onto a machine, and gave it a go. I ended up falling in love with the GNOME desktop.</p>
            <p>It had it’s fair share of problems at the time tough. It would slow up after using it for a while, the shell was prone to enough crashes to make it noticeable, and it would not in general run as fast on my hardware as something like Unity 7 or MATE.</p>
            <p>I still loved it though, and I ended up bouncing between it and Ubuntu MATE for the rest of the year and into 2017. By this point, I had also given <a class="inline-link" href="https://lubuntu.me/">Lubuntu</a> a run or two, and I rather liked it, but not enough to use it as much as GNOME or MATE.</p>
            <p>It’s 2017 now. The new 17.04 releases have come out, I download the ISOs for Lubuntu, GNOME, and MATE, and have a play around with them. It wasn’t to long after this time that Canonical decided to end work on Unity 7 &amp; 8, and switch to using the GNOME 3 desktop.</p>
            <hr />
            <h2 id="bouncing-around-all-over-the-place">Bouncing Around all Over the Place</h2>
            <p>I started experimenting with Linux a lot more in 2017. I tried out distros such as <a class="inline-link" href="https://neon.kde.org/">KDE neon</a>, Fedora (failed with this one, but it makes a comeback later on,) <a class="inline-link" href="https://tails.boum.org/">Tails</a>, (I think) <a class="inline-link" href="https://qubesos.org/">Qubes</a>, and others, just to get a good feel for them and to quench my thirst for new discoveries and constant change.</p>
            <p>This continued all through the year, with my mainstays being Ubuntu MATE, Ubuntu GNOME, and KDE neon.</p>
            <p>Once 2018 rolled around, the new LTS releases of Ubuntu were on their way. I finally got Fedora installed on a machine, and ended up falling in love with it and proclaimed it as my primary distro by the time Ubuntu 18.04 came out. I find the timing of this interesting, as I held an install fest for 18.04, and I was now using Fedora.</p>
            <p>I bounced around Ubuntu, Ubuntu MATE, KDE neon, Fedora, and <a class="inline-link" href="https://spins.fedoraproject.org/kde/">Fedora KDE</a> throughout the year, moving from one to the other like they were seasonal clothing.</p>
            <p>The year is coming to a close now. Ubuntu 17.10 released, I got hooked on MATE again, I even finally got a family member to have me install it on their computer!</p>

            <h2 id="the-arch-arc">The Arch Arc</h2>
            <p>By the end of November, I had been looking into <a class="inline-link" href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> pretty seriously, and was looking to give it a go. On December 5th, I installed Arch onto my desktop computer. I wanted to give Arch a go for a couple of reasons. One was a sort of right of passage, another was for the most up to date packages, and yet another was for the complete customization of the system.</p>
            <p>I ended up installing and reinstalling Arch quite a few times between the beginning of December and the end of January. I had a few installs stick around for quite some time, but for one reason or another, I ended up doing the old ‘nuke and pave’ more times than I can truly remember.</p>
            <hr />
            <h2 id="starting-to-settle-down">Starting to Settle Down</h2>
            <p>It’s now May of 2019. I have been running Arch as my main distro for the past 6 months, without really changing to another distro. However, There was a new hat on the rack, Fedora 30, and I was dying to give it a go.</p>
            <p>I ended up using Fedora as my main OS again, albeit alongside Arch, and this trend kept up for a few months, bouncing between using Fedora as my main and using Arch as my main. However, now I was starting to want ti finally settle down with a distro, finally have a proper Linux to call home.</p>
            <p>I believe it’s about mid to late September now, and Ubuntu has released it’s beta images for 19.10. I had been using the daily ISOs for both proper and MATE for a bit now in a VM, and, still having a bit of distro hopper in me, I installed the Ubuntu MATE 19.10 Beta onto my main desktop.</p>
            <p>I was quite impressed by the improvements that Ubuntu MATE has gotten since I last properly used it. The panel issues I had encountered from 16.04 were largely gone (although it does sill have it’s hiccups from time to time,) and was a rather pleasant experience all in all.</p>
            <p>After the proper release of 19.10, I installed it onto my laptop, and upgraded the desktop to the full release version.</p>

            <h2 id="finally-finding-my-linux-home-1">Finally Finding My Linux Home</h2>
            <p>I am still running Ubuntu MATE on my machines, the exact same installs from before, and I have no plans on that changing anytime in the future.</p>
            <p>Ubuntu MATE is what really got me to start using Linux properly, and it is what got me to finally make the switch form Windows to Linux. I find it fitting that it has become what I truly believe to be my Linux home, the distro I call home.</p>
            <p>I have used quite a few Linux distros and flavors over these past few years. I’ve used distros such as Ubuntu (with Unity and now with GNOME), Ubuntu MATE, Ubuntu GNOME, <a class="inline-link" href="https://debian.org/">Debian</a>, Fedora, Fedora KDE, <a class="inline-link" href="https://elementary.io/">Elementary OS</a>, Qubes, and Arch, to name some of them.</p>
            <p>I will say this though; Ubuntu MATE, I believe, is truly the distro for me. I don’t know quite what it is about it, but whatever it is, I have always enjoyed using it, I have always loved it, and I am glad that I have finally settled in with it, and am using it as my daily driver.</p>
