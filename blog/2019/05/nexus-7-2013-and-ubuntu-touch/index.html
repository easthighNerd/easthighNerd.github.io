            <h1>Nexus 7 2013 (WiFi) and Ubuntu Touch</h1>
            <img src="./nexus-7-2013-wifi-scopes.png" height=450>
            <p>About a month ago (give or take) I purchased a Nexus 7 2013 (WiFi) with the intent of flashing Ubuntu Touch (OTA 9) onto it. I had previously flashed Ubuntu Touch onto a Nexus 5 that I had gotten for Christmas last year, again with the intent of flashing Ubuntu Touch onto it, so I knew what I could look forward to and what I could expect.</p>

            <h2>Flashing Ubuntu Touch</h2>
            <img src="./ubports-installer-nexus-7-2013-wifi.png" height=300>
            <p>Flashing Ubuntu Touch onto the Nexus 7 was pretty easy overall. First thing I had to do was install <code>adb</code> and <code>fastboot</code> onto my computer (running Ubuntu), as well as the <code>ubports-installer</code> snap.</p>
            <p>Next, on the nexus 7 I needed to enable developer mode, enable USB debugging, unlock the bootloader, and re-enable dev mode and USB debugging. After that, I hooked up the Nexus 7 to my PC and launched the UBports Installer. It detected that the Nexus 7 was connected and pulled up the menu for flashing it right away. I clicked the needed buttons to flash it and let it do it's thing.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Initial Setup</h2>
            <p>After Ubuntu Touch was flashed onto the Nexus 7, I went through the initial setup of the device. First was the standard stuff like setting up WiFi and creating a user account.</p>
            <p>After that, I made sure any updates were applied and went on to install the apps I use from the Open Store, as well as any that I made myself.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Day-to-Day Usage</h2>
            <p>Using this thing more-or-less every day for about the past month, it has worked great! I use it to check the weather, browse my Mastodon feed, shop on Amazon, and more!</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Papercuts</h2>
            <p>Of course, my experience has not been perfect. While I have not had any major issues using Ubuntu Touch on the Nexus 7, here are some papercuts that I have come across:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Screen orrientaion is locked to landscape on lockscreen</li>
            <li>WiFi may not auto-reconnect. Pulling down WiFi menu may reconnect Wifi. Disabling WiFi and re-enabling reconnects WiFi</li>
            <li>Username on lockscreen does not move when keyboard pulls up</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>All in all, I love this thing! Ubuntu Touch is maturing nicely, and is very much in a usable, daily driver state. The Nexus 7 is a nice tablet, with a good screen resolution, feel, and size.</p>
            <p>Of course, you may suffer from a lack of apps compaired to what you may be used to from iOS or Android, however there is a nice selection of apps available on the Open Store that may fill almost any role you need them to.</p>
            <p>Overall, I would definitely suggest this setup to anyone wanting a nice tablet with a free OS on it, or simply a nice tablet experience overall!</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Afterword: App Picks</h2>
            <p>Here are some apps I recommend using on Ubuntu Touch:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>FluffyChat (Matrix Client)</li>
            <li>Podbird (Podcast client)</li>
            <li>Telegram/TELEports* (Telegram)</li>
            <li>uMastonauts (Mastodon client)</li>
            <li>Recorder (audio recorder)</li>
            <li>uAdBlock (system-wide ad blocker)</li>
            <li>UT Tweak Tool (tweak UT even more. Use caution!)</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="font-size: 15px;"><i>*TELEports is still in beta as of writing</i></p>
