            <h1>Nexus 7 2013 (WiFi) and Ubuntu Touch</h2>
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/easthighNerd/easthighnerd.writeas.com/master/2019/05%20May/Nexus%207%202013%20WiFi%20and%20Ubuntu%20Touch/nexus-7-2013-wifi_scopes.png" height=450>
            <p>About a month ago (give or take) I purchased a Nexus 7 2013 (WiFi) with the intent of flashing Ubuntu Touch (OTA 9) onto it. I had previously flashed Ubuntu Touch onto a Nexus 5 that I had gotten for Christmas last year, again with the intent of flashing Ubuntu Touch onto it, so I knew what I could look forward to and what I could expect.</p>
            <h2>Flashing Ubuntu Touch</h2>
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/easthighNerd/easthighnerd.writeas.com/master/2019/05%20May/Nexus%207%202013%20WiFi%20and%20Ubuntu%20Touch/ubports-installer_nexus-7-2013-wifi.png" height=300>
            <p>Flashing Ubuntu Touch onto the Nexus 7 was pretty easy overall. First thing I had to do was install `adb` and `fastboot` onto my computer (running Ubuntu), as well as the `ubports-installer` snap.</p>
            <p>Next, on the nexus 7 I needed to enable developer mode, enable USB debugging, unlock the bootloader, and re-enable dev mode and USB debugging. After that, I hooked up the Nexus 7 to my PC and launched the UBports Installer. It detected that the Nexus 7 was connected and pulled up the menu for flashing it right away. I clicked the needed buttons to flash it and let it do it's thing.</p>
            <h2>Initial Setup</h2>
            <p>After Ubuntu Touch was flashed onto the Nexus 7, I went through the initial setup of the device. First was the standard stuff like setting up WiFi and creating a user account.</p>
            <p>After that, I made sure any updates were applied and went on to install the apps I use from the Open Store, as well as any that I made myself.</p>
            <h2>Day-to-Day Usage</h2>
            <p>Using this thing more-or-less every day for about the past month, it has worked great! I use it to check the weather, browse my Mastodon feed, shop on Amazon, and more!</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Papercuts</h2>
            <p>Of course, my experience has not been perfect. While I have not had any major issues using Ubuntu Touch on the Nexus 7, here are some papercuts that I have come across:</p>
            <p>* Screen orrientaion is locked to landscape on lockscreen
                * WiFi may not auto-reconnect. Pulling down WiFi menu may reconnect Wifi. Disabling WiFi and re-enabling reconnects WiFi
                * Username on lockscreen does not move when keyboard pulls up</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>All in all, I love this thing! Ubuntu Touch is maturing nicely, and is very much in a usable, daily driver state. The Nexus 7 is a nice tablet, with a good screen resolution, feel, and size.</p>
            <p>Of course, you may suffer from a lack of apps compaired to what you may be used to from iOS or Android, however there is a nice selection of apps available on the Open Store that may fill almost any role you need them to.</p>
            <p>Overall, I would definitely suggest this setup to anyone wanting a nice tablet with a free OS on it, or simply a nice tablet experience overall!</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Afterword: App Picks</h2>
            <p>Here are some apps I recommend using on Ubuntu Touch:

            <p>    * FluffyChat (Matrix Client)</p>
            <p>    * Podbird (Podcast client)</p>
            <p>    * Telegram/TELEports* (Telegram)</p>
            <p>    * uMastonauts (Mastodon client)</p>
            <p>    * Recorder (audio recorder)</p>
            <p>    * uAdBlock (system-wide ad blocker)</p>
            <p>    * UT Tweak Tool (tweak UT even more. Use caution!)</p>
            <br>
            <p>    *TELEports is still in beta as of writing</p>
